README File for Matlab scripts and functions for estimating survey efficacy.

Please see documentation in supplementary folder for detailed assistance.

estimateSurveyQuality_template.m is a script which incorporates all of the below
functions and will produce the desired output:
	1. importSurvey.m
	2. surveyDim.m
	3. plotSurvey.m
	4. surveyEfficacy.m
	
You can use and call each function individually in your own script, but I recommend 
using the template as it is all set up and easy to use. 

Other functions which are required are stored in the supplementary folder:
	1. bluewhitered.m
	2. ll2utm.m
	3. utm2ll.m
	4. picplot.m
	
Other files in the tracks and supplementary folders include files which can be used for 
the current template set up, which serves as a fuctioning example. These are:
	1. Track Acacia adunca Bien Donne main site 20210119.gpx
	2. Track Acacia adunca Bien Donne second site 20210119.gpx
	3. Waypoint Acacia adunca Bien Donne 20210119.gpx
	4. BDF.jpg (google earth image)
	5. BDF.jgw (google earth image world file)
	6. Example adunca bien donne 2021.png (example of image output)
	
Information on how to obtain the world file for a google earth image can be found in the
